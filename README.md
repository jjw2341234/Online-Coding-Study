ðŸ“Œ Solve a total of 10 questions per week (weeks when both Mondays and Fridays are not public holidays) (= the number of non-public holidays * 2 questions)
Example 1) If you solve one question each weekday, you have to solve the remaining five questions on the weekend
Example 2) If you solve two questions on weekdays, you don't have to solve them on weekends
ðŸ“Œ Silver3 or higher Baekjun problem, Lv.2 or higher programmers problem only
